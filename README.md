### Introduction:

Reducing cancellation rates in hotel bookings is essential for better revenue management and customer satisfaction. This project aims to develop a predictive model to help hotel managers in predicting the probability of booking cancellations.

### Data:

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information on hotel bookings from two hotels in Portugal, covering a period of about two years. The dataset includes a total of 32 variables, consisting of categorical, numerical, and date-time features. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned for missing values and outliers.

### Analytics:

The Analytics folder contains the Jupyter notebook file, where exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the characteristics of the data. The notebook also includes visualization of different features, correlation analysis, and feature engineering. This step is important to select the most important features and remove any irrelevant features.

### Modeling:

The Modeling folder contains the Jupyter notebook file, where predictive modeling is performed using different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. The performance of each model is evaluated using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model with the best performance is selected and used for predictions.

### Conclusion:

The final model developed through this project can help hotel managers to identify the probability of a booking cancellation in advance. By predicting which bookings are more likely to be canceled, managers can take appropriate measures such as adjusting their booking policies or offering incentives to prevent cancellations. This project demonstrates the importance of predictive modeling in improving revenue management and customer satisfaction in the hotel industry.
